## Does Nonverbal IQ Modulate the Relation Between Phonological Awareness and Reading Skill? Harmonization of Multi-Site Pediatric Task-Based fMRI-data - BrainHack Vanderbilt 2025

![fMRI_harmonization](fMRI_harmonization.png)

### Project Description

Research shows that reading skill (i.e. accuracy of reading words aloud) and phonological awareness (i.e. sensitivity to the sound structure of language) are bi-directionally related, but we do not know how non-verbal IQ (i.e. sensitivity to stimulus patterns) influences this relationship. The proposed project seeks to examine how nonverbal IQ modulates the effect of (1) behavioral differences in phonological awareness on the neural basis of reading skill and (2) behavioral differences in reading skill on the neural basis of phonological awareness.

Neuroimaging data for this project were collected across various sites using different scanners. Pooling fMRI data across multiple sites is critical for improving the generalizability of findings to a diverse population. However, multi-site fMRI data are often affected by non-biological variability, attributable to differences in scanner manufacturers, non-standardized imaging acquisition parameters, or other intrinsic factors. This source of variability may lead to limited statistical power or even result in spurious findings. The objective for Brainhack Vanderbilt 2025 is to develop a harmonization pipeline designed to reliably remove between-scanner variability and ensure reproducibility for downstream analyses.
